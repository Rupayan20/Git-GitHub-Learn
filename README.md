## Introduction

This repository contains detailed notes on Git and GitHub, aiming to cover a wide range of topics from basic to advanced concepts. These notes are useful for anyone looking to improve their understanding of version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.

## Terminology

Git and people who use it talk in a different terminology. For example they don’t call it a folder, they call it a repository. They don’t call it alternative timeline, they call it branch. Although, I agree that alternative timeline is a better name for it.

## Git behind the scenes

Git is a version control system that allows us to track changes to our files and folders. It is a powerful tool that can help us manage our code more effectively. In this section, we will explore the basics of how git works internally.

## Branched in git

Branches are a way to work on different versions of a project at the same time. They allow us to create a separate line of development that can be worked on independently of the main branch. This can be useful when we want to make changes to a project without affecting the main branch or when we want to work on a new feature or bug fix.

## getting started with Github

Github is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It is a popular platform for developers to collaborate on projects and to share code. Github provides a user-friendly interface for managing and tracking changes to your code, as well as a platform for hosting and sharing your projects with others.
